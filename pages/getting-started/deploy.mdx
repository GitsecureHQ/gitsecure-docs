## Create A New Project

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying a simple NextJS project using PipeOps.

To create a new project, go to your PipeOps dashboard and click on the "New Project" button.

## Select Project Type

PipeOps supports the deployment of three types of projects:

- **Web projects**: These are applications that are accessed through a web browser, such as a website or web application.
- **Worker projects**: These are background tasks or processes that run independently of a web server.
- **Job projects**: These are short-lived, one-time tasks that are triggered by an external event or schedule.

No matter what type of project you are working on, PipeOps makes it easy to deploy and manage your applications in the cloud.

Select the web project.

## Select Project Source

When creating a new project on PipeOps, you will need to select your project source and organization. The project source is the location of your code repository, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. The organization is the group or team that owns the project. This is useful if you are working on a project as part of a larger team and want to manage access and permissions for different members. By selecting your project source and organization, PipeOps can connect to your code repository and begin deploying your application.

Once you have selected your project source and organization, you will need to choose which project and branch to deploy. The project is the name of your code repository, and the branch is the specific version of the code that you want to deploy. By selecting the appropriate project and branch, you can ensure that you are deploying the correct code to your application. PipeOps makes it easy to deploy multiple branches of your code, allowing you to easily test and roll out new features and updates.

Depending on the plan you are subscribed to, you may have the option to customize your project name, choose a specific server and environment, and make other configuration changes. The project name is the name that will be displayed in your PipeOps dashboard and used to identify your application. The server and environment refer to the specific infrastructure that your application will be deployed to, such as a staging or production environment. By adjusting these settings, you can tailor your deployment to meet the specific needs of your project.

## Deploy Project

After you have selected your project and branch, you will need to choose your project framework and any required environment variables. The project framework is the specific technology or platform that your application is built on, such as Node.js, Ruby, or Python. Environment variables are key-value pairs that store information that your application needs to run, such as database credentials or API keys. By selecting your project framework and adding any necessary environment variables, you can ensure that PipeOps has the information it needs to properly deploy and run your application. Once you have made these selections, you can simply click the "Deploy" button to start the deployment process. PipeOps will handle the rest, including building and deploying your application and setting up the required infrastructure.

If your deployment is successful, you should see the outputs displayed in the images below. These outputs show the status of your deployment and any relevant information, such as the URL of your application or any error messages. By reviewing these outputs, you can ensure that your deployment was successful and troubleshoot any issues that may have occurred.
